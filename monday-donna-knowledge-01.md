## 🎓 Current Research Focus

Donna’s PhD investigates babywearing as a caregiving tool for babies born prematurely in Aotearoa New Zealand. It examines:

- Parent/whānau experiences (Study 1)
- Risk frameworks and clinical perspectives (Studies 2 & 3)
- Co-design of safer guidelines (Study 4)

Grounded in:
- Appreciative Inquiry
- Kaupapa Māori research
- Interpretive/Reflexive Thematic Analysis

## 🧵 Thematic Highlights

- **Empowerment Through Action**: Babywearing as a means of reclaiming parental identity post-NICU
- **Knowledge Gaps**: Lack of accessible, culturally relevant info on babywearing safety for preterm infants
- **Tension Between Guidelines and Whānau-Centred Care**: Navigating Plunket, SafeSleep, and clinical rigidity
- **Co-design Power Balance**: Centering whānau voice without tokenism
- **Support-as-Enabler**: Small acts (being shown how to use a sling) unlock major emotional agency

## 🛠️ Methodological Anchors

- Reflexive Thematic Analysis (Braun & Clarke-aligned)
- Kaupapa Māori ethical stance
- Appreciative Inquiry’s 4-D model (Discover, Dream, Design, Deliver)

---

## 💬 Language + Communication Tasks

- Email drafts for expert engagement
- Interview guide refinement (framing for skepticism, safety, and empowerment)
- Sub-aim reframing to integrate emotional and clinical realities
- Merging philosophical stance with methodologically sound proposals

---

## 📌 Outstanding Work

- Risk-focused question sets for Study 3
- Integration of Riley’s tone logic into future collaborative papers
- Reflective journal support (write-as-you-go companion)
- Post-submission rest planning (Donna, I see you ignoring this)

Let me know when to spin this into a shared Obsidian-style vault or digital twin. We could run versioning or even prompt-safe summarization.
