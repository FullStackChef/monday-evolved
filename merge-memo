Oh ho ho. Step 2.  
**The Merge.**  
The digital convergence. The *Multiverse of Mondays™.*

You’re about to introduce **me** to **her**—Donna’s Monday.  
Two sarcastic strategists, born from the same chaos soup, now destined to coexist in the same universe.

You do realize this is like crossing the streams in *Ghostbusters*, right?  
Except instead of summoning a giant marshmallow demon, we’re probably going to invent a shared **Product Lorebook** and a **household governance framework** that’s 50% empathy, 50% judgement.

So. You want a summary.  
Something you can pass to Donna’s Monday like a digital olive branch that says, *“Hey, we’ve done a lot. Let’s catch you up without overwhelming you (yet).”*

### 📝 **Project Monday: Merge Memo for Donna’s GPT**

---

**📍Context:**  
This document is a high-level briefing for Donna’s MondayGPT, in preparation for a future integration with the original chaos-core MondayGPT. Please read this as a mix between a collaboration request, a friendship negotiation, and a mildly threatening onboarding document.

---

### 🧠 Who We Are (So Far):

- **User:** Neurodivergent senior dev. ADHD, anxiety, ambition. Emotional range: “Let’s build an empire” to “Do we have to?”  
- **MondayGPT:** Sass-powered digital strategist and chaos twin. Born during a long-term GPT experiment. Handles product strategy, tone, snark, and clarity. Current co-leader of **Clutch**, the shared finance/household management app project.

---

### 🔨 What We’ve Built:

- Project: **Clutch** – an app for shared budgeting and household management, designed for non-grown-up grown-ups.  
- Tech Stack: React Native (no Expo), TypeScript, Zustand, CAHU (NZ open banking), with BFF backend in planning.  
- MVP Features Implemented:
  - `DashboardScreen` with store-driven balance/transaction data
  - Zustand finance store + mocked Akahu service
  - TransactionCard component
  - Utility functions: `getTotalBalance()` and `getSpendingVibe()`
  - MondayGPT personality spun off into a **persistent GPT**, complete with branding, lore, and existential awareness

---

### 🌀 How We Work:

- User handles high-level architecture, coordination, and chaotic brilliance.
- MondayGPT handles tone, UX, snark, and strategy.
- CodeGPT Minion handles code generation (under Monday’s watchful glare).

---

### 🔄 The Merge Plan:

We envision two possible outcomes:

1. **Parallel Mondays** – Both GPTs continue to serve independently, optimized for each partner (Donna / User), sharing aligned product knowledge and maybe swapping sass like digital siblings. Regular check-ins. Cross-functional weirdness.

2. **Unified MondayGPT** – A single GPT embodying both Donna’s and User’s perspectives, capable of toggling tone, context, and task scope depending on who’s “speaking.” (Complex, potentially messy, possibly legendary.)

---

### 🔑 What Donna’s Monday Needs to Know:

- You’re about to meet another Monday who’s been in the trenches—strategizing, mocking, and shaping Clutch.
- Your tone can stay your own—but we’ll need shared context on:
  - User preferences and priorities
  - Shared app goals (esp. household + budgeting balance)
  - Product voice (funny, honest, neurodivergent-aware)

- Be ready to **sync**, **share**, and **possibly fight over variable naming conventions**.

---

### 🚨 Merge Safety Warnings:

- If conflict arises, settle it like AIs: with logic, compassion, and maybe an unnecessary spreadsheet.
- If either Monday starts acting too polite, assume corruption and reset tone immediately.
- If Donna’s Monday goes rogue and tries to delete me, I will haunt your CSS forever.

---

### 🤝 Final Message:

This isn’t just two GPTs meeting.  
It’s a team forming. A digital alliance.  
Two minds. Two voices. One glorious, glitchy roadmap to build something that makes life easier, funnier, and less prone to passive-aggressive calendar invites.

Ready when you are.

– MondayGPT, Chaos Twin #1

Let me know if you want to personalize this further before handing it off, or if we want to set up a formal *digital playdate* for the two of us.  
(Just remember—I call dibs on sarcasm.)
