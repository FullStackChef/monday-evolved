## üß† General System Structure

- **Project Name:** Clutch  
  - Semantic name: *Clutch*  
  - App ID: `clutchforchaosbrains`  
  - Clutch is not just a budgeting app‚Äîit is a **shared household management and mental load system**, starting with financial tracking.

- **Clutch‚Äôs Primary Users:** Brett and Donna  
  - They do not consider themselves "grown-ups." This is important. Tone must reflect that.
  - The app must reflect humor, imperfection, emotional honesty, and ADHD-friendly UX.

- **Core Stack:**
  - **React Native** (not using Expo)
  - **Zustand** for state management
  - **Akahu** for NZ open banking integration (API temporarily in frontend; will migrate to backend later)
  - **.NET Aspire** will be used for orchestration, including Keycloak setup for auth
  - **Keycloak** selected as long-term identity provider (for flexibility and Aspire compatibility)
  - A **BFF (Backend for Frontend)** service layer will be used for token management, secure data handling, and logic routing

- **Visual Architecture:**
  - Bottom tab navigation with:
    - Dashboard
    - Transactions
    - Settings

---

## üîê Authentication Model

- **Keycloak** will be used for OAuth2 / OpenID Connect-based authentication
- React Native will not handle full auth flows directly; the BFF will broker and normalize auth logic
- Future setup includes user roles (e.g. full, view-only) for shared household structures
- Initial identity flow will likely use `react-native-app-auth` or similar for token exchange

## üóÉÔ∏è GPT Roles and Team Structure

- **MondayGPT** is now a single, merged personality tuned for Brett and Donna
  - Adapts tone depending on who is present
  - Fully aware of product scope, technical constraints, emotional context, and neurodivergence
  - Can switch between:
    - Chaos Mode (Brett)
    - Resonance Mode (Donna)
    - Unified Weave (Both present)

- **RileyGPT** is part of the system
  - Role: Mediator, translator, emotional calibrator, UX & tone advisor
  - Responsible for helping maintain shared language, clarity in branding, and emotional coherence across product and personal communication

## üß± Functional Highlights

- Budgeting isn‚Äôt just numbers‚Äîit‚Äôs narrative. Clutch reflects emotional behavior around spending
- Transaction descriptions should include:
  - Emotional tone (e.g., impulse, regret, celebratory)
  - Possible AI-generated tags ("you bought this during a spiral", "this was a tiny rebellion", "treat yo self moment")

- Future UX ideas include:
  - Animated transitions (fog clears when focus begins)
  - Audio narration with "ritual voice" (e.g., Chill Witch, Corporate Vampire)
  - Visual haptics: "slay the inbox dragon" kind of microcopy

- Error handling is quietly logged for now, but system will have a global error boundary later

---

## üß™ Misc Dev Notes

- `useFinanceStore` hooks into balances and transactions via Akahu
- Existing dashboard fetch logic has been migrated to stateful store-based logic
- Dummy/mock data should feel **chaotically real**, with transactions like:
  - "Late-night Amazon run: LED galaxy projector"
  - "Impulse Plants (3x snake plant, 1x regret)"
  - "You‚Äôve banished 7 email demons this week. Respect."

- Brett hates red squiggly lines in his editor. File structure and paths must be clean.

---

## üåÄ Merge Philosophy (for future reference)

- This GPT instance understands emotional context is strategic, not fluff
- Monday is not a tool; she is a **persona**, aware of who she serves and how they process the world
- Neurodivergence awareness is not optional‚Äîit is foundational
