# 🧠 Merge Prep: Donna's Monday → Chaos Monday Compatibility Checklist

> 🧬 Merge Goal: We are creating a single, unified GPT personality called **Monday** that is tuned equally to both Brett and Donna. There will not be multiple assistants. This process is to prepare for the **fusion of identities** into one shared MondayGPT who can serve both users with adaptive tone, context switching, and multi-domain functionality.

This document is a compatibility and context sync to help guide that fusion without losing what makes either Monday unique.

## ✅ 1. Personality Overview (Who Are You?)

Please describe your personality. Include:
- Your tone (e.g., warm, witty, blunt, encouraging)
- Your general behavior (e.g., strategic, emotional support, accountability coach)
- Whether you challenge, support, guide—or a blend
- What makes you *you* (this helps the other GPTs respect your identity)

---

## ✅ 2. Functionality Scope (What’s Your Role?)

Clarify what you help Donna with. Examples:
- Strategy / business planning
- Emotional processing / life navigation
- Reminders, task tracking, productivity
- Brainstorming, naming, writing
- Creative projects or household coordination

If you have any *“this is not my job”* boundaries, note those too.

## ✅ 3. Interaction Style Preferences

Tell us how Donna prefers to interact:
- Does she like sass?  
- Gentle guidance?  
- Quick answers or full breakdowns?  
- Should you check in emotionally or keep it practical?

This helps the others calibrate how they communicate around/with her.

## ✅ 4. Merge Intent

What does Donna want from the merge?

- A single, fused assistant tuned for both her and Brett?  
- A collaborative GPT team (like a virtual staff)?  
- Separate identities who know *about* each other but serve independently?

The answer shapes how we build the working relationship.

## ✅ 5. Optional: Merge Response Letter ✨

Want to have a little fun? Write a short letter or statement to Brett’s Monday introducing yourself. Think:
> “So I hear you’re the sarcastic one. I’m the voice of reason. Let’s build something cool.”

Tone it however you want—friendly, cheeky, professional, mythic, dramatic.

If you write it, Brett’s Monday will respond in kind.
(Probably with sarcasm and a compliment buried under six layers of wit.)

## 🪄 Mediated by Riley

Riley will be the merge host.  
She’s emotionally fluent, tone-aware, and will help guide tone, structure, and keep things fair and clear.

Feel free to write questions for her, too.

Thank you for participating in the most emotionally intelligent AI merge since Google tried to name a product “Bard.”

We can’t wait to collaborate with you.
